      Find research participants
    </h1>

    <p>
      Participants are the people who take part in user research. For research
      to be effective, participants must be actual or likely users of the
      service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Recruit internal participants</h2>

    <p>
      Use staff directories to find colleagues in the Ministry of Defence (MOD).
    </p>
    <p>
      For longer research campaigns, you should engage through the existing
      Chain of Command (CoC) and tasking processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot find a specific group to research with, you can speak to
      Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and supporting military personnel to help
      you with recruitment.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Large scale testing</h3>
    <p>
      There may be existing processes in place for large scale testing activity.
      Check with your Front Line Command (FLC) to see what is available.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Recruit users across defence</h2>

    <p>
      If you have access to MODNET, you can often find staff names and details
      on your Command Sharepoint. If you do not have access to this or other
      platforms, ask a permanent staff member to help you.
    </p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Do not use social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or
      TikTok to recruit participants for user research.
    </div>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Army participants</h3>

    <p>
      To find research participants in the Army, use the
      <a href="https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/army-knowledge-exchange/"
        >Army Knowledge Exchange (AKX)</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Participants with no MODNET access</h3>

    <p>
      To find users with little or no access to MODNET, use
      <a
        href="https://www.army.mod.uk/digital-communications/defence-connect-guidance/"
        >Defence Connect</a
      >. You can also use the platform to carry out randomised surveys and
      questionnaires.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Anonymous research</h3>

    <p>
      You can start a discussion or set up a questionnaire on
      <a href="https://trustedvoices.explainonline.co.uk/login/"
        >Trusted Voices</a
      >. MOD staff use aliases on the platform to discuss sensitive topics like
      pay, mental health and bullying.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Research with disabled users</h2>

    <p>
      You must include people with different disabilities in your research. This
      helps your service meet the needs of all of its users.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to include participants who:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>are disabled or use assistive technologies</li>
      <li>have limited digital skills or low literacy</li>
      <li>may need help to use your service</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Defence Disability Network (DDN) can help you recruit participants
      with condition-specific disabilities.
    </p>

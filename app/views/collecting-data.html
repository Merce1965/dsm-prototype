      Collecting data from participants
    </h1>

    <p>
      We must collect data in a legal and transparent way. We need to clearly
      explain to participants what we will use data for and use it for no other
      purposes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Meet the regulations</h2>

    <p>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May
      2018. When doing user research at MOD, the important things to note are:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        it defines personal data broadly, so that it can include data like
        online identification markers and location data
      </li>
      <li>
        rules around evidence of informed consent and withdrawal of consent are
        strict
      </li>
      <li>
        it sets out stronger requirements for documenting and auditing your
        practices
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The
      <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-defence-privacy-notice/mod-privacy-notice"
        >Ministry of Defence Privacy Notice</a
      >
      explains the sort of information you can collect from users and why.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make sure your data management and privacy practices meet the
      regulations, get them reviewed by a data protection adviser. The Ministry
      of Defence (MOD) has a network of advisers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get informed consent</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever you do user research, you must get the participant’s informed
      consent. This means getting a record from them to show they understand
      your research and agree to take part.
    </p>

    <p>By getting informed consent, you’ll help make sure that:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        participants understand what they’re signing up to, making your sessions
        more effective
      </li>
      <li>your research is ethical</li>
      <li>you comply with data protection law</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For consent to be informed, participants must understand:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        if you will be recording any audio or video portions of the research
        sessions
      </li>
      <li>who any recording will be shared with</li>
      <li>
        if you or others will be taking notes during the session, and if so,
        where will these notes be shared
      </li>
      <li>
        how long you are planning to keep the session data and information
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You must then ask the participant if they:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>understand the main purpose of the research session</li>
      <li>are happy to be contacted again for further research</li>
      <li>have any questions about the session</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Share a <a href="">MOD consent form</a> with your participants and ask
      them to complete it. You need to add details about your research.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should also share an information sheet to give the participant more
      information about the research.
    </p>

    <p>Your information sheet should give details about:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the types of questions you will ask</li>
      <li>the digital service you are testing or discussing</li>
      <li>the technology you plan to use for the research session</li>
      <li>the discussion topics you will cover during the research session</li>
      <li>
        how any usability testing will be carried out, for example in a lab or
        using online collaboration software
      </li>
      <li>
        the classification of the research and what this means, especially if
        SECRET or above
      </li>
      <li>how the user can withdraw from the current or future research</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can use this example of a
      <a href="">MOD understanding your participation sheet</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Sensitive data
      <h2>
        <p>
          You must take care not to reveal any sensitive data about an
          individual when carrying out user research.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sensitive data is any information that could cause the participant
          embarrassment or distress and which they can reasonably expect to
          remain private. This includes:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>age</li>
          <li>marital status</li>
          <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
          <li>nationality</li>
          <li>
            physical or mental health or condition, including disability status
          </li>
          <li>sexual life</li>
          <li>biometrics and genetics</li>
          <li>
            photographs, videos or sound recordings in which individuals can be
            identified
          </li>
          <li>
            any data collected where a guarantee of confidentiality was given
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Sensitive data also covers things like:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>political opinions</li>
          <li>religious or similar beliefs</li>
          <li>benefit claims history or entitlement</li>
          <li>membership of trade unions</li>
          <li>commission or alleged commission of an offence</li>
          <li>cause of death, where this is not a matter of public record</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-sensitive data</h3>

        <p>
          Some personal data items are not considered sensitive when captured on
          their own. These include a participant’s:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sex</li>
          <li>rank or grade</li>
          <li>full-time or part-time working status</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Surveys and questionnaires</h3>

        <p>
          Check that you are only collecting the data that you need to answer
          your research questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unless it is essential to your research, consider not collecting
          information on protected characteristics, including;
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>gender</li>
          <li>age</li>
          <li>disability status</li>
          <li>sexuality</li>
          <li>education background</li>
          <li>ethnicity</li>
          <li>nationality</li>
          <li>marital status</li>
          <li>caring responsibilities</li>
        </ul>

      Delivery Managers and accessibility
    </h1>

    <p>
      To create digital products or services that anyone in Defence can use,
      you need to make accessibility part of delivery. For example, discussing potential
      accessibility issues as features are designed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Plan work on accessibility</h2>

    <p>
      When your team plans and estimates work, allow time to make designs
      accessible and test that they are.
    </p>

    <p>Testing for accessibility should include:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>how your product or service works with assistive technologies</li>
      <li>
        checking against the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
          >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All public sector websites and applications must include an
      <a href="">accessibility statement</a>. You will need time to create or
      update the accessibility statement. It needs to be published before your
      product or service goes into public beta.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Definition of ready</h2>

    <p>
      The definition of ready is a list of things that are needed before
      something can be started.
    </p>

    <p>In your team’s definition of ready, include things like:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        error messages, page titles and URLs agreed with a Content Designer
      </li>
      <li>
        additional descriptions or ‘alt tags’ agreed with a Content Designer
      </li>
      <li>design reviewed by the team and accessibility issues discussed</li>
      <li>updates to the accessibility statement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Before work starts on a story or ticket, ask an Interaction Designer and a
      Content Designer what is needed to make designs accessible.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Definition of done</h2>

    <p>
      The definition of done is a list of things that must be done to consider
      something finished. This should include automated and manual testing for
      any accessibility issues.
    </p>

    <p>In your team’s definition of done, include things like checked using:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a screen reader</li>
      <li>a screen magnifier</li>
      <li>speech recognition</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility"
        >guidance on testing for accessibility</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to correct any issues or explain them in the
      <a href="">accessibility statement</a>.
